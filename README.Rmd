# SpNeigh

SpNeigh provides methods for neighborhood-aware analysis of spatial 
transcriptomics data. It supports boundary detection, 
spatial weighting (centroid- and boundary-based), 
spatially informed differential expression using spline-based models, 
and spatial enrichment analysis via the Spatial Enrichment Index (SEI). 
Designed for compatibility with Seurat objects and spatial data frames, 
SpNeigh enables interpretable, publication-ready analysis of 
spatial gene expression patterns.
