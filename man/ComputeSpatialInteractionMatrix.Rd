\title{Compute a spatial neighborhood interaction matrix using K-nearest neighbors (KNN)}
\usage{
ComputeSpatialInteractionMatrix(data = NULL, k = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A Seurat object or a data frame with columns: \code{x}, \code{y}, \code{cell}, and \code{cluster}.}

\item{k}{Integer. Number of nearest neighbors to use for each cell. Default is 10.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix where rows represent focal clusters and columns represent neighboring clusters.
Each cell in the matrix indicates how frequently a neighbor cluster appears among the k-nearest neighbors
of cells from the focal cluster.
}
\description{
Computes a spatial interaction matrix where each entry quantifies the number of neighboring cells
from a given cluster (columns) that are among the \code{k}-nearest neighbors of cells in another cluster (rows).
This provides a summary of spatial proximity and enrichment of neighboring clusters around each focal cluster.
}
\details{
The matrix is built by identifying the \code{k} nearest neighbors for each cell based on spatial coordinates,
and then tabulating the cluster identities of those neighbors with respect to the cluster identity of the focal cell.

\examples{
# Load coordinates
coords <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "MouseBrainCoords.rds", package = "SpNeigh"))

# Compute interaction matrix using all cells
interaction_matrix <- ComputeSpatialInteractionMatrix(coords)
head(interaction_matrix)

# Compute interaction matrix for cells inside boundaries
boundary_points <- GetBoundary(data = coords, one_cluster = 2, eps = 120, minPts = 10)
cells_inside <- GetCellsInside(data = coords, boundary = boundary_points)
coords_sub <- subset(coords, cell \%in\% cells_inside$cell)
ComputeSpatialInteractionMatrix(coords_sub)

# Compute interaction matrix for cells inside ring regions
ring_regions <- GetRingRegion(boundary = boundary_points, dist = 100)
cells_ring <- GetCellsInside(data = coords, boundary = ring_regions)
coords_sub <- subset(coords, cell \%in\% cells_ring$cell)
ComputeSpatialInteractionMatrix(coords_sub)
