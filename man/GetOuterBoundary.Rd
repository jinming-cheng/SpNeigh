\title{Generate an outer or inner boundary polygon by buffering
an existing boundary}
\usage{
GetOuterBoundary(boundary = NULL, dist = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{boundary}{A data frame of boundary points
(with columns \code{x}, \code{y}, \code{region_id}) or an \code{sf} object.}

\item{dist}{A numeric value specifying the buffer distance in spatial units.
Use positive values to expand (outer boundary),
and negative values to shrink (inner boundary). Default is 100.}
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object of expanded outer boundary polygons with the
same \code{region_id} values as the original input.
}
\description{
Computes an expanded or shrunken boundary by applying a spatial buffer
to an existing polygon.
The input can be either boundary points (as returned by \code{GetBoundary()})
or polygon geometries (as returned by \code{BuildBoundaryPoly()}).
This is useful for defining outer spatial neighborhoods or for
shrinking boundaries inward to define inner regions.
}
\details{
Be careful: when using a negative buffer distance (for inner boundaries),
polygons may collapse, become invalid, or disappear entirely if the
buffer width exceeds the shape's interior size.

\examples{
# Load coordinates
coords <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "MouseBrainCoords.rds",
    package = "SpNeigh"
))

# Get boundary points of cluster 2
boundary_points <- GetBoundary(data = coords, one_cluster = 2)

# Build polygons from boundary points
boundary_polys <- BuildBoundaryPoly(boundary_points)

# Generate outer boundaries with 100-unit buffer
outer1 <- GetOuterBoundary(boundary_points, dist = 100)
outer2 <- GetOuterBoundary(boundary_polys, dist = 100)

# Plot original and expanded boundaries
plot(boundary_polys)
plot(outer2, add = TRUE, border = "red")
