\title{Plot spatial weights for cells on a spatial plot}
\usage{
PlotWeights(
  data = NULL,
  weights = NULL,
  point_size = 0.2,
  theme_ggplot = my_theme_ggplot()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or Seurat object containing spatial coordinates.
Must include columns: \code{cell}, \code{x}, and \code{y}.}

\item{weights}{A named numeric vector of spatial weights,
with cell IDs as names.}

\item{point_size}{Numeric. Point size of the cells in the plot.
Default is \code{0.2}.}

\item{theme_ggplot}{A ggplot2 theme object. Default is \code{my_theme_ggplot()}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} object displaying a scatter plot of cells
colored by weights.
}
\description{
Visualizes spatial weights by plotting cell coordinates colored by
a numeric weight value.
Only cells in \code{data} that match the names in \code{weights} will be included.
This is useful for visualizing spatial trends such as proximity to
boundaries or centroids.
}
\examples{
# Load coordinate data
coords <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "MouseBrainCoords.rds",
    package = "SpNeigh"
))

# Cells in cluster 2
cells_c2 <- subset(coords, cluster == 2)[, "cell"]

# Compute centroid weights and plot
weights_cen <- ComputeCentroidWeights(data = coords, cell_ids = cells_c2)
PlotWeights(data = coords, weights = weights_cen)

# Compute boundary weights and plot
boundary_points <- GetBoundary(data = coords, one_cluster = 2)
weights_bon <- ComputeBoundaryWeights(
    data = coords, cell_ids = cells_c2,
    boundary = boundary_points
)
PlotWeights(data = coords, weights = weights_bon)
