\title{Generate an inner boundary polygon by shrinking an existing boundary inward}
\usage{
getInnerBoundary(boundary = NULL, dist = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{boundary}{A data frame of boundary points
(with columns \code{x}, \code{y}, \code{region_id})
or an \code{sf} object of \code{POLYGON} geometries.}

\item{dist}{A positive numeric value specifying how far inward to
shrink the boundary.
This is automatically converted to a negative buffer distance.
Default is 50.}
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object containing the inward-shrunk polygons,
one per \code{region_id}.
}
\description{
Computes an inward-shifted (contracted) boundary by applying a
negative spatial buffer to an existing boundary polygon.
This function is a wrapper around \code{getOuterBoundary()} and is useful
for defining an inner region around a spatial cluster or structure.
}
\details{
Be careful: if the shrinkage distance is too large, the resulting geometry
may become invalid or disappear entirely, especially for narrow
or irregular shapes.

\examples{
# Load coordinates
coords <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "MouseBrainCoords.rds",
    package = "SpNeigh"
))

# Get boundary polygons of cluster 2
boundary_points <- getBoundary(data = coords, one_cluster = 2)
boundary_polys <- buildBoundaryPoly(boundary_points)
plot(boundary_polys)

# Generate inner boundary with 50-unit buffer for boundary region 1
inner_boundary <- getInnerBoundary(boundary_polys)
plot(inner_boundary)
