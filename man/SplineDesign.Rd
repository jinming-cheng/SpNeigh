\title{Generate a spline-based orthonormal design matrix from a numeric covariate}
\usage{
SplineDesign(x, df = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector representing a continuous variable.}

\item{df}{Degrees of freedom for the spline basis. Default is 3.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix with orthonormal columns derived from the spline-transformed input.
The first column is aligned to show the main linear trend with respect to \code{x}.
}
\description{
This function transforms a numeric input vector (e.g., spatial distance)
into a natural cubic spline basis and returns an orthonormalized design matrix
suitable for smooth trend modeling.
The first column of the output matrix is guaranteed to be positively correlated
with the input vector and typically captures the primary linear trend.
}
\examples{
x <- runif(100)
Z <- SplineDesign(x)

# The first column of Z is positvely correlated with x
cor(Z[,1], x)

}
