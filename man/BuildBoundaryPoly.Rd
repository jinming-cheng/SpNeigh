\title{Convert boundary points into valid polygon geometries}
\usage{
BuildBoundaryPoly(boundary = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{boundary}{A data frame of boundary points, typically returned
by \code{GetBoundary()}.
Must contain columns \code{x}, \code{y}, and \code{region_id}.}
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object containing one or more valid \code{POLYGON} geometries
with a \code{region_id} column.
}
\description{
Constructs spatial polygon objects from boundary points generated by
the \code{GetBoundary()} function.
Each set of boundary points (grouped by \code{region_id}) is converted
into a closed polygon.
This function ensures that each polygon is valid and ready for
downstream spatial analysis.
}
\examples{
# Load coordinates
coords <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "MouseBrainCoords.rds",
    package = "SpNeigh"
))

# Get boundary points for cluster 2
boundary_points <- GetBoundary(data = coords, one_cluster = 2)

# Convert to polygon
boundary_polys <- BuildBoundaryPoly(boundary_points)

# Plot the resulting polygons
plot(boundary_polys)
