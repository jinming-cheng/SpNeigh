\title{Generate ring regions between a boundary and its outer buffer}
\usage{
GetRingRegion(boundary = NULL, outer_boundary = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{boundary}{A data frame of boundary points
(with columns \code{x}, \code{y}, \code{region_id}) or an \code{sf} object.}

\item{outer_boundary}{Optional \code{sf} object containing
buffered (outer) boundary polygons.
If not provided, it will be automatically computed
using \code{GetOuterBoundary()}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{GetOuterBoundary()}
if \code{outer_boundary} is not provided.}
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object containing the ring-shaped spatial regions generated by
subtracting each inner boundary polygon from its corresponding
outer boundary polygon.
}
\description{
Computes spatial ring-shaped regions by subtracting the original
boundary polygons from their corresponding outer buffered polygons.
If the \code{outer_boundary} is not supplied, it will be automatically computed
using \code{GetOuterBoundary()}.
This is useful for analyzing periphery-enriched cell types or
gradient-based features near a boundary.

\examples{
# Load coordinates
coords <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "MouseBrainCoords.rds",
    package = "SpNeigh"
))
head(coords)

# Get boundary points of cluster 2
boundary_points <- GetBoundary(data = coords, one_cluster = 2)

# Automatically compute outer boundary and get rings
ring_regions <- GetRingRegion(boundary = boundary_points, dist = 100)
plot(ring_regions)

# Or provide both inner and outer boundaries explicitly
outer <- GetOuterBoundary(boundary_points, dist = 100)
rings <- GetRingRegion(boundary = boundary_points, outer_boundary = outer)
plot(rings)
