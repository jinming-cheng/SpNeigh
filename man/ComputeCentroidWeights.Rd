\title{Compute spatial weights based on distance to the centroid}
\usage{
ComputeCentroidWeights(
  data = NULL,
  cell_ids = NULL,
  scale = TRUE,
  method = c("inverse", "gaussian", "linear", "quadratic"),
  sigma = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or Seurat object containing spatial coordinates. Must include columns: \code{cell}, \code{x}, and \code{y}.}

\item{cell_ids}{A character vector of cell IDs to use for weight computation.}

\item{scale}{Logical. Whether to scale distances to the range [0, 1] before applying decay functions. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{method}{Decay function to convert distances to weights. One of: \code{"inverse"}, \code{"gaussian"}, \code{"linear"}, or \code{"quadratic"}.}

\item{sigma}{Standard deviation for the Gaussian decay (used only if \code{method = "gaussian"}). Default is \code{0.5} (recommended for scaled distances).}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector of weights (length = number of cells in \code{cell_ids}). Higher weights correspond to cells closer to the centroid.
}
\description{
Computes spatial weights for a set of cells based on their Euclidean distance
to the centroid of the selected group of cells. This is useful for modeling
gradient-like spatial expression centered around a cluster or region.
Supports multiple decay methods and optional distance scaling.

\examples{
# Load spatial coordinates
coords <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "MouseBrainCoords.rds", package = "SpNeigh"))

# Select cells from cluster 2
cells_c2 <- subset(coords, cluster == 2)$cell

# Compute centroid-based weights using default settings
weights <- ComputeCentroidWeights(data = coords, cell_ids = cells_c2)
head(weights)
