\title{Plot cells located within spatial boundaries or ring regions}
\usage{
PlotCellsInside(
  cells_inside = NULL,
  point_size = 0.5,
  colors = my_colors_15,
  theme_ggplot = my_theme_ggplot(),
  legend_size = 2,
  fixed_aspect_ratio = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cells_inside}{An \code{sf} object of cells returned by \code{GetCellsInside()}. Must contain \code{cluster} and \code{region_id} columns.}

\item{point_size}{Numeric. Size of the points representing cells. Default is 0.5.}

\item{colors}{A vector of cluster colors. Default uses \code{my_colors_15}.}

\item{theme_ggplot}{A ggplot2 theme object. Default is \code{my_theme_ggplot()}.}

\item{legend_size}{Numeric. Size of legend keys. Default is 2.}

\item{fixed_aspect_ratio}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, uses \code{geom_sf()} to preserve spatial scale.
If \code{FALSE}, uses \code{geom_point()} with extracted coordinates. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object showing the cells colored by cluster within spatial regions.
}
\description{
Visualizes cells that fall within defined spatial regions (boundaries or rings),
typically obtained using the \code{GetCellsInside()} function. The cells are colored by cluster,
and the function offers two plotting modes: using \code{geom_sf()} (with fixed 1:1 aspect ratio)
or \code{geom_point()} (with more flexible layout).

\examples{
coords <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "MouseBrainCoords.rds",
                              package = "SpNeigh"))

# Plot cells inside boundaries
boundary_points <- GetBoundary(data = coords, one_cluster = 2)
cells_inside <- GetCellsInside(data = coords, boundary = boundary_points)
PlotCellsInside(cells_inside)

# Plot cells inside rings
ring_regions <- GetRingRegion(boundary = boundary_points, dist = 100)
cells_ring <- GetCellsInside(data = coords, boundary = ring_regions)
PlotCellsInside(cells_ring, fixed_aspect_ratio = FALSE)
