\title{SpNeigh: Spatial Neighborhood Modeling and Differential Expression Analysis for Transcriptomics}
\description{
SpNeigh provides methods for neighborhood-aware analysis of spatial transcriptomics data. It supports boundary detection, spatial weighting (centroid- and boundary-based), spatially informed differential expression using spline-based models, and spatial enrichment analysis via the Spatial Enrichment Index (SEI). Designed for compatibility with Seurat objects, SpatialExperiment objects and spatial data frames, SpNeigh enables interpretable, publication-ready analysis of spatial gene expression patterns.
