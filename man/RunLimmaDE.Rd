\title{Differential expression analysis between two group of cells using \code{limma}}
\usage{
RunLimmaDE(
  exp_mat = NULL,
  cells_reference = NULL,
  cells_target = NULL,
  weights = NULL,
  adj_p.value = 0.05,
  min.pct = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{exp_mat}{A normalized gene expression matrix with genes as rows and cells as columns. For example, the log-normalized data in a Seurat object.}

\item{cells_reference}{A vector of cell IDs for the reference (baseline) group.}

\item{cells_target}{A vector of cell IDs for the target (comparison) group.}

\item{weights}{Optional numeric vector of observation-level weights for each cell (same length as combined groups). For example, the scaled spatial distance between cells and the boundary.}

\item{adj_p.value}{Adjusted p-value threshold for significance to obtain differentially expressed genes. Default is 0.05.}

\item{min.pct}{Minimum proportion of cells expressing the gene in at least one group. Default is 0.}
}
\value{
A data frame of differentially expressed genes between two cell groups
}
\description{
Performs differential expression analysis between two groups of cells using the
\code{limma} package. Supports optional observation-level weights and filters genes
based on minimum expression percent in either group.
