\title{Convert boundary polygons to boundary point coordinates}
\usage{
BoundaryPolyToPoints(boundary_poly = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{boundary_poly}{An \code{sf} object containing only \code{POLYGON} or
\code{LINESTRING} geometries.
Must include a \code{region_id} column for labeling
subregions.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns \code{x}, \code{y}, and \code{region_id},
containing the vertex coordinates of the boundary geometries.
}
\description{
Extracts the vertex coordinates (\code{x}, \code{y}) of boundary geometries
from an \code{sf} object containing \code{POLYGON} or \code{LINESTRING} features.
This is useful for recovering the original boundary points from
smoothed or labeled polygonal regions.
}
\examples{
# Load coordinates and generate boundary
coords <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "MouseBrainCoords.rds",
    package = "SpNeigh"
))
boundary_points <- GetBoundary(data = coords, one_cluster = 2)
boundary_polys <- BuildBoundaryPoly(boundary_points)

# Convert back to boundary points
boundary_pts <- BoundaryPolyToPoints(boundary_polys)
head(boundary_pts)
