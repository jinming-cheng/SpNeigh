# SpNeigh ![](reference/figures/SpNeigh_logo.png)

SpNeigh provides methods for neighborhood-aware analysis of spatial
transcriptomics data. It supports boundary detection, spatial weighting
(centroid- and boundary-based), spatially informed differential
expression using spline-based models, and spatial enrichment analysis
via the Spatial Enrichment Index (SEI). Designed for compatibility with
Seurat objects, SpatialExperiment objects and spatial data frames,
SpNeigh enables interpretable, publication-ready analysis of spatial
gene expression patterns.
