Description: SpNeigh provides methods for neighborhood-aware analysis of spatial 
    transcriptomics data. It supports boundary detection, 
    spatial weighting (centroid- and boundary-based), 
    spatially informed differential expression using spline-based models, 
    and spatial enrichment analysis via the Spatial Enrichment Index (SEI). 
    Designed for compatibility with Seurat objects, SpatialExperiment objects
    and spatial data frames, SpNeigh enables interpretable, 
    publication-ready analysis of spatial gene expression patterns.
