Description: SpNeigh provides methods for neighborhood-aware spatial 
    transcriptomics analysis. It supports boundary detection, 
    spatial weighting (centroid- and boundary-based), 
    spatially-informed differential expression using spline-based models, 
    and spatial enrichment scoring via the Spatial Enrichment Index (SEI). 
    Designed for seamless integration with Seurat objects and 
    spatial data frames, SpNeigh enables interpretable and publication-quality 
    analyses of spatial expression patterns.
