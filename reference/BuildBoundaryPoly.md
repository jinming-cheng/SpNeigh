# Convert boundary points into valid polygon geometries

Constructs spatial polygon objects from boundary points generated by the
[`GetBoundary()`](https://github.com/jinming-cheng/SpNeigh/reference/GetBoundary.md)
function. Each set of boundary points (grouped by `region_id`) is
converted into a closed polygon. This function ensures that each polygon
is valid and ready for downstream spatial analysis.

## Usage

``` r
BuildBoundaryPoly(boundary = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- boundary:

  A data frame of boundary points, typically returned by
  [`GetBoundary()`](https://github.com/jinming-cheng/SpNeigh/reference/GetBoundary.md).
  Must contain columns `x`, `y`, and `region_id`.

## Value

An `sf` object containing one or more valid `POLYGON` geometries with a
`region_id` column.

## Examples

``` r
# Load coordinates
coords <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "MouseBrainCoords.rds",
    package = "SpNeigh"
))

# Get boundary points for cluster 2
boundary_points <- GetBoundary(data = coords, one_cluster = 2)

# Convert to polygon
boundary_polys <- BuildBoundaryPoly(boundary_points)

# Plot the resulting polygons
plot(boundary_polys)

```
