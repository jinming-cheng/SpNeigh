# Generate ring regions between a boundary and its outer buffer

Computes spatial ring-shaped regions by subtracting the original
boundary polygons from their corresponding outer buffered polygons. If
the `outer_boundary` is not supplied, it will be automatically computed
using
[`GetOuterBoundary()`](https://github.com/jinming-cheng/SpNeigh/reference/GetOuterBoundary.md).
This is useful for analyzing periphery-enriched cell types or
gradient-based features near a boundary.

## Usage

``` r
GetRingRegion(boundary = NULL, outer_boundary = NULL, ...)
```

## Arguments

- boundary:

  A data frame of boundary points (with columns `x`, `y`, `region_id`)
  or an `sf` object.

- outer_boundary:

  Optional `sf` object containing buffered (outer) boundary polygons. If
  not provided, it will be automatically computed using
  [`GetOuterBoundary()`](https://github.com/jinming-cheng/SpNeigh/reference/GetOuterBoundary.md).

- ...:

  Additional arguments passed to
  [`GetOuterBoundary()`](https://github.com/jinming-cheng/SpNeigh/reference/GetOuterBoundary.md)
  if `outer_boundary` is not provided.

## Value

An `sf` object containing the ring-shaped spatial regions generated by
subtracting each inner boundary polygon from its corresponding outer
boundary polygon.

## Examples

``` r
# Load coordinates
coords <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "MouseBrainCoords.rds",
    package = "SpNeigh"
))
head(coords)
#>          x        y cell cluster
#> 1 1898.815 2540.963    1       4
#> 2 1895.305 2532.627    2       4
#> 3 2368.073 2534.409    3       2
#> 4 1903.726 2560.010    4       4
#> 5 1917.481 2543.132    5       4
#> 6 1926.540 2560.044    6       4

# Get boundary points of cluster 2
boundary_points <- GetBoundary(data = coords, one_cluster = 2)

# Automatically compute outer boundary and get rings
ring_regions <- GetRingRegion(boundary = boundary_points, dist = 100)
plot(ring_regions)


# Or provide both inner and outer boundaries explicitly
outer <- GetOuterBoundary(boundary_points, dist = 100)
rings <- GetRingRegion(boundary = boundary_points, outer_boundary = outer)
plot(rings)
```
